//window.onresize() probably gonna have somekind of refresh/load function that will fire when you resize the screen, to make things fit again.
// how to change position??? there might be an easy jquery way to do dragging, you could also just put left and right buttons on stuff.
//what's the edit button for? the textarea is better.
//color select button might be nice.
//library read() function myight be helpful, so you don't have to write the function to look at all the notes each time.

//login/register buttons for users. db. yeah yeah
